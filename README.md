# About Trinity

Trinity is the perfect match for Neo4J in the java-matrix :O.

Nah! kidding! :D. This little toy project is defined to learn about Java 18 capabilities, java code generation using
annotation processors, DSLs, and enjoy learning new things on neo4j.

As starting point, it tries to mimmick / adapt ideas from [neomodel](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel) to java.
